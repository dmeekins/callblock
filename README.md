# callblock - Python junk call blocker.
# Home Page: http://dmeekins.github.io/callblock/

Callblock is a simple daemon written in Python that uses a modem to listen for
incoming calls and issues a hangup if caller ID data matches a blacklist. It is
based off the "jcblock" project by Walter Heath (jcblock.sourceforge.net).

It contains a configuration file to run as a service under systemd.

I use a TRENDnet USB modem (TFM-561U), as mentioned inn the jcblock README.


# Installing

Manual install example for CentOS 7:
